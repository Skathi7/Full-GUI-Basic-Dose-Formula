# Full-GUI-Basic-Dose-Formula
This is meant to be a super simple java dose calculator displayed in the swing and have a full GUI. Do not use this to actually calculate real world doses,  this is more meant as a demonstration of the code. The formula the program uses to calucalte the dose is (desired dose / amount on hand) * number of tablets = dose.
