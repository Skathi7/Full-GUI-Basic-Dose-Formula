# Full-GUI-Universal-Dose-Formula
This is meant to be a super simple java dose calculator displayed in the swing and have a full GUI. I do not recommend using this to actually calculate real world doses of course,  this is more meant as a demonstration of the code. The formula the program uses to calucalte is (desired dose / amount on hand) * number of tablets = dose.
